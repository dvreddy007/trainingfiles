<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br/>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <a href="one.html" target='_blank'>specimen</a> book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <b>typesetting</b>, remaining <strong>essentially</strong> unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <i>software</i> like <span style="color:red; font-style:italic">Aldus PageMaker</span> including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
